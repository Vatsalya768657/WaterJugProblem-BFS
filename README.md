# Water Jug Problem using Breadth First Search (BFS)

## Problem Description
This project solves the classical Water Jug Problem using State-Space Search
and Breadth First Search (BFS).

- Jug A Capacity: 4 Liters
- Jug B Capacity: 3 Liters
- Goal: Obtain exactly 2 liters of water in Jug A

## Approach
The problem is modeled as a state-space search problem where each state is
represented as a pair (A, B), indicating the amount of water in Jug A and Jug B.

Breadth First Search (BFS) is used to explore all possible states level by level
to ensure the shortest sequence of operations is found.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- State-Space Search

## How to Run the Program
1. Clone the repository or download the project
2. Open terminal inside the project folder
